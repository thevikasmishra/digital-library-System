Challenges Faced:
Naming issues (BookSerevice instead of BookService).
Concurrency errors (ObjectOptimisticLockingFailureException).
Duplicate fields (bookid and id).
Implementing case-insensitive search by title.
GitHub integration & deployment difficulties.
Lack of API documentation.

Future Improvements:
Add pagination & sorting for better performance.
Integrate Swagger for API documentation.
Enhance error handling & validations using @Valid.
Use DTOs instead of exposing entities directly.
Write unit & integration tests with JUnit/Mockito.
Deploy to cloud platforms like AWS or Render.
